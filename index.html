                <p>Howdy there! My name is Jeff, and I love teaching. I believe that students deserve the opportunity to do whatever it is that motivates them, and so as a teacher, it's my responsibility to make sure that learning stays delicately balanced exactly halfway between boredom and panic: in the learning zone.</p>
                <p>One of the most important pieces of writing I've ever read is the Doodle Alley comic called <a href="https://doodlealley.com/2012/10/10/be-friends-with-failure/">Be Friends with Failure"</a> because it articulates an important truth about learning. In short, there is no way to learn without encountering failure. Success is a sign you're ready to do something new, and failure is a sign you're already doing something new.</p>
